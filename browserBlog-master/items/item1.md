<h3>Experience 1: OpenED Multimedia Co-op placement</h3>
<body>

1. **What I did:** I worked at openED connected with the university of Guelph in the multimedia Department to assist in making content for students in the upcoming online fall semester.
2.  **When:** The summer of 2020 is when I worked this Co-op job.
3.  **What I liked about it:** There were a number of things that we're good at all this experience. I got to work as a part of a fully functioning team. I learned about and practice with various different types of software I have never used before such as Vyond, and various Closed Captioning Software, as well as Microsoft Teams and Zoom for video conferencing.
4. **Memorable Moment:** My favorite memory was when my boss had given me really fantastic feedback during the midterm report. That all my hard work had been paying off.
5. **Disliked:** If I had to choose something I did not like, it would be the closed captioning since it was extremely tedious
6. **Grade:**  A
